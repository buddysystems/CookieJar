# Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a module bundler for JS projects.

## Background

One of the problems with JS in our project is that there are so many versions of JS, each with different language features and browser support.

ECMAScript is the language specification for JS. In 2015, ECMAScript 2015 (aka ECMAScript6 or **ES6**) came out. It has many great features that we would like to us
(such as support for classes, arrow functions, and native modules /`import` and `export` keywords). This last point is important because modules are awesome :)

## The problem

So what is the problem with all this? Why don't we just use the latest flavor of JS and be done with it? Well, for one, browser support for ES6 isn't all there. Not every browser can
support every ES6 feature. This isn't as much of a problem with our extension, as it is only targeted as chromium base browsers.
